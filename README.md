# spotify-dashboard

The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard via Dash about Spotify Data. The specific diagrams of this dashboard includes:

-  a customisable Sankey Chart, where the users can create Sankey diagrams for data analysis based on any two columns of data. Two dropdown menus enable users to select columns from the dataset to visualize the flow of data between them. The Sankey diagram is generated based on the selected columns. This provides users a visual representation of data connections and relationships, allowing them to better understand the data structure.

-  a Streaming Statistics tab provides insights into streaming data over time. A range slider allows users to select specific months for analysis. This facilitates a focused examination of streaming trends over time. From the slider, the bar graph updates to display streaming statistics based on the selected date range, making it easy to track changes and trends of streams over time.

-  The Musical Statistics tab displays a facet plot showing the relationship between musical attributes - key, mode, and BPM. This graph allows users to explore how these attributes are distributed and related within the dataset. Specifically, this graph allows users to alernate between major and minor, as in modes, with bubble graphs showcasing frequency of songs with a particular bpm and key, demonstrating the commanality between popular songs
